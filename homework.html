  <p class="p1">
    The major constraint in a CEO’s skill development is their speed in recognizing patterns and adopting successful models. It’s often possible to shortcut this process by reading the right book. Many 10X CEOs have achieved significant personal breakthroughs because they read the right book at the right time.
  </p>
  <p class="p2">
    But there are too many books and not enough time. Some of the famous bestselling business books make for interesting stories, but the most valuable books are the ones that deal with a critical area of a business and provide a “best practice” framework that a CEO can adopt, and often spread throughout his or her organization.
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
    This very quirky (and charmingly/annoyingly dated) book set in a manufacturing plant contains the single most important CEO insight I’ve seen, which is to focus your energy on identifying and unlocking the primary constraint of the business. Any problem that is not connected to the primary constraint, while it may feel good to solve, doesn’t do anything to move the business forward. You can’t be a 10X CEO until you grasp and live by this insight.
